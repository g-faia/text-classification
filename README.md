# Text Classification

This is a survey on deep learning models for text classification and we will continue to update. Text Classification has been the most competed NLP task in kaggle and other similar competitions. Although many traditional proposals based on traditional algorithms achieve good results, the community also wish to improve the classification performance further. 


## Environment Settings

In this survey, we pay more attention to models' details, not datasets (domain), so trying a small dataset named *Movie Reviews*. In the recent, we only use the *Tensorflow* to implement our models, and the training process run on a *GTX1080* gpu single machine.

1. scikit-learn==0.19.1
2. tensorflow-gpu==1.10.1
3. tensorboard==1.10.0
